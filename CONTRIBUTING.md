## Branches explained

As you can see we have multiple branches:
 - **master**: This branch stores the latest stable version of Galio.
 - **examples**: Our Expo app where we showcase our components and screen examples
 - **design**: Here we have design resources for everybody to download and use
 - **Alpha-1**: This is the `dev` branch of Galio

## Hacktoberfest 2018

Galio participated in this year's Hacktoberfest challenge. You can find out more about this [here](https://github.com/galio-org/galio/issues/31).

## Financial contributions

We also welcome financial contributions in full transparency on our [open collective](https://opencollective.com/galio).
Anyone can file an expense. If the expense makes sense for the development of the community, it will be "merged" in the ledger of our open collective by the core contributors and the person who filed the expense will be reimbursed.
